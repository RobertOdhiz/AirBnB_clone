### AirBnB Clone
## Project Description
 A clone of the AirBnB. Starts with the console in Python with file management using JSON.

 Followed by a simple static Frontend in HTML that communicates with the backend in Flask Restful API.

 Switching to a MySQl DB instead of the original JSON file storage and management. Building a well functional RESTful API in FLASK that allows a dynamic Frontend in JS, HTML and CSS to communicate with the backend.
